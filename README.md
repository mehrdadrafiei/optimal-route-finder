*Assignment:
Build an API that takes inputs of start and finish location both within the USA
Return a map of the route along with optimal location to fuel up along the route -- optimal mostly means cost effective based on fuel prices
Assume the vehicle has a maximum range of 500 miles so multiple fuel ups might need to be displayed on the route
Also return the total money spent on fuel assuming the vehicle achieves 10 miles per gallon
Use the attached file for a list of fuel prices 
Find a free API yourself for the map and routing

*Requirements:
Build the app in Django 3.2.23
Send your results for this project within 3 days of receiving the exercise
The API should return results quickly, the quicker the better
The API shouldn't need to call the free map/routing API you found too much. One call to the map/route API is ideal, two or three is acceptable
Make a loom where you use Postman or similar API platform to demonstrate the API working while also giving a quick overview of your code. 5 minutes max
